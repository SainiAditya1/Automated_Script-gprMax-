To test the script on different operating systems, you can follow these steps:

Windows:

Ensure that Git and Python are installed on your Windows machine.
Open a command prompt or PowerShell.
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script using the Python interpreter:
python install_gprmax.py

Ubuntu:

Open a terminal
Install Git and Python if they are not already installed:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script using the Python interpreter
python3 install_gprmax.py


macOS:

Ensure that Homebrew and Python are installed on your macOS machine.
Open a terminal.
Install Git and Python if they are not already installed
brew install git python3
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script using the Python interpreter.
python3 install_gprmax.py


Please note that you may need to adjust the script permissions and provide administrative privileges (sudo) where necessary. Additionally, ensure that you have a stable internet connection during the installation process for cloning the GprMax repository and installing the dependencies.

After running the script on each operating system, observe the output and any error messages to determine if the installation of GprMax was successful or if any issues occurred.
